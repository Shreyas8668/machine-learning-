This project builds a predictive machine learning model to help a Portuguese banking institution identify customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on direct marketing campaign data (2008–2010).

The goal is to support the bank’s marketing team in targeting the right customers and improving campaign efficiency.

Domain: Finance / Banking

Total Features: 20 input variables

Target Variable: y (Term Deposit Subscription – Yes/No)

The dataset contains customer demographic details, campaign-related information, and economic indicators.

⚠️ The duration feature was removed to prevent data leakage, as it is only known after the call ends.
